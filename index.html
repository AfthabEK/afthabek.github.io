                        NewPipe is a lightweight frontend for popular streaming services like YouTube, SoundCloud and PeerTube. It is completely ad-free and offers features like background playback and downloads, which are often restricted on other streaming platforms like the YouTube app. You don&rsquo;t need an account for it as it parses the website of the streaming service to fetch the data we require. You can still subscribe to channels you like and this data is locally stored, ensuring a secure and private user experience.
